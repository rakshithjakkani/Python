functions with outputes:
=========================

def function_1(f_name, l_name):
    """It takes first and last name. And it will formate into title case then give it to you""" # this is called Docstrings
    fi_name = f_name.title()
    la_name = l_name.title()
    return f"{fi_name} {la_name}"

def function_2(name):
    return f"{name}"
output = function_2(function_1("rakshith", "jakkani"))
print(output)

# On the above code we can understand 2 things, one is title() function which makes starting letter capital and remaning are small. Like if we give rakshith as a input, it will return Rakshith.
# The second thing is "return". which is extensively usefull when you want to use function_1() output in another function function_2().
# Difference b/w print and return is like, Use return when you want to send a value from one point in your code to another. Using return changes the flow of the program. Using print does not.
# return should only use under the function. when you want to print outside of function use print.
# when you add any lines of code after return, the function won't excute them. Bcz, python thinks that function is ended at return.
# Docstrings are nothing but a description of your function. it should be the first line after defining your function
