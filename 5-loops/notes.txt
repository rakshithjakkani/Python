For loop:
========

for item in list_of_items
    # do something to each item

# Try below example
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "tomato"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
    # this loop is executed each time for each fruit in list of fruits
    # when for loop started executed, it will assign a variable for apple like fruit = "apple", next fruit = "banana" and so on
    # This loop is used when you need to execute some part of the code or whole part of the code  multiple times

# printing the sum of total number using for loops and sum function
numbers = [9, 4, 5, 7, 4, 4 8,098,5, 938,376, 23, 65, 099]
print(sum(numbers)) # generally this will print the total number but for a change we will build our own sum function using for loop

## building max function using for loop
numbers = [9, 4, 5, 7, 4, 4, 8, 98, 5, 938, 376, 23, 65, 99]
max = 0
for a in numbers:
    if a > max:
        max = a
    # in the first execution a = 9 and it will check if a > 0 then it will become max = a (max = 9)
    # for next execution a = 4 and it will check if a > 9 then skip execution if block.
    # in serveral next executions  98 = 9 and it will check if a > 9 then it will become max = a (max = 98)
    # so on it will execute all the elements in the list and it will hold the max number 

Range function in for loop:
---------------------------

for a in range(starting_number, ending_number, step_number ): #step_number is nothing but difference between number to number
    print(a) # 

for a in range(1, 101):
    print(a) #this will print the number from 1 to 100

sum100 = 0
for a in range(1, 101):
    sum100 += A
print(sum100) #this will print the sum of value of 1+2+3+4.......100
