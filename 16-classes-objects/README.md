* Attributes and methods combinedly can do the tasks.
    * Attributes are nothing but the variables that we define in the python. We call them as a "attributes"
        for example:
            course_name = "python"
            tutor = "rakshith_jakkani"
    * Object are nothing but a functions. A part of a code executed when we call them
        for example:
            list = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
            def example_function:
                for item in list
                    print(item)
            example_function()
* For implementing any object we need a blue print, in case of python we call it "class"
* Example:
    * Let's we have a virtual restaurent, with 2 waitors and 1 manager
    * Here we call waitor and manager as a "object" because they have to execute something as part of their
    * For hiring any other waitor we need a data like which kind of waitor we need with what qualities. so we need a blue print
    * we call that blueprint as a class in python
