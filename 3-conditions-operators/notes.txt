    statements
else:
    statements

operators:
a % b --> modulo operator
    * this operator is used like a divide by b 
    * for example 10 % 5 remainder is 0, 10 % 3 remainder is 1
    * any number that is devisable by 2 is even, which is not divisable by 2 is even
    * 10 % 2 --> even, 33 % 2 --> odd
a > b --> greater than
a < b --> less than
a >= b --> greater than or equal to
a <= b --> less than or equal to 
a == b --> equal
a != b --> not equal
